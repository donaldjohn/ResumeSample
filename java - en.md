## WORKING EXPERIENCE

### <a href="http://www.ipph.cn">Intellectual Property Publishing House(IPPH)</a> （ 2013.4 ~ present）

##### <a href='http://epub.sipo.gov.cn'>Gazette Electronic Publication System of SIPO</a>
I developped the prototype of the system. Found and implemented a solution that view large PDF files online.
The website is the official patent gazette Publishing website of China, it provides China patent gazette search and browse service. The search function is implemented with Oracle and full-text database TRS. The most difficult part of this project is to implement a PDF viewer that works in all  most used browsers. The gazette files always very large, their size usually go to more than 2G bytes, I need to find a way to load the giant PDF file progressively. In order to get rid of malicious downloading, it requires to hide the real file path. Tried some solutions, found that the JS related solutions usually convert PDF files to HTML5 pages, it works not well in earlier versions of IE like IE7. Finally, I choose the FlexPaper(now renamed to FlowPaper), when the user navigating around the PDF file in their browser, the corresponding pages are converted to separated swf files in the server, then transferred to the front side by Stream, by this way the PDF files' paths  are hidden. The solution fulfilled the requirement of the Online PDF Viewer.
#### <a href="http://www.laichushu.com/">Laichushu Self-publishing Platform</a>
I participated this project from beginning to end. Laichushu is a portal website combined with ERP and E-commerce function. Users can register and upload their manuscript, buy books that published by IPPH, staffs of IPPH can work on the platform to revise those uploaded manuscripts. I am the PM of this project in fact, I cooperated all the stakeholders, divided tasks and made plans. Besides, I also engaged in the coding tasks. The project is a great challenge to me, thanks god, it went to online successfully.

This website is a typical Java EE project built with SSH(Spring MVC, Spring boot, Hibernate), it enhanced my Java EE knowledge.
